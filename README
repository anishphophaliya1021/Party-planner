This is the Party Planner application.
Please read before grading..
Notes:
	-The emails are being sent out and can be seen in the rails console. However they are not being recieved due to some weird error.
	-Added to the populate file the code for adding the default admin. The username is aphophal and the password is "secret".
	-The RSVP works! However we need to get the invite code from the database as emails are not being recieved.
	-The forgot your password link sends an email with a randomized password which can be used to login and change the password.
	-All my Cucumber tests don't pass because I have a field called "date" in the party and not "party_date" (as this was in the ERD).
	-There are some other cucumber tests which show error due to formatting.
	-Most of the unit tests pass.
	-The only unit tests that fail are for either the Host (left as it is) or because they don't recognize 'destroy' in the teardown method.
